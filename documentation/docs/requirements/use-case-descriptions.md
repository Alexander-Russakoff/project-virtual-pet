# Use-Case Descriptions

### Challenge Oriented (Gamer)

<i> As a User, I like to maximize the progression of in-game characters. I enjoy the process of assigning rewards to these characters and to see them grow.</i>

1. User navigates to their vatar’s interaction page.
2. User has a set of acquired rewards in the form of ‘candies’ and ‘accessories’ (placeholder names for now).
User drags ‘accessories’ to the avatar and the animations are now changed to show the avatar wearing the ‘accessory’.
2. User drags ‘candies’ to the avatar.
3. The avatar shows an eating animation and a satisfied animation.
4. A stat (or set of stats, possibly chosen by the User) increases when the ‘candy’ is consumed.
5. When certain milestones, or ‘levels’, are reached, the avatar changes or ‘grows’.

### Companionship and Comfort

<i> As a User, I want to have a companion to assist in motivating me toward my education goals. I will link Canvas to my Virtual Pet.</i> 

1. The User creates a profile.
2. The User selects an avatar from a list of options.
3. The User navigates to the Canvas Integration section of the site.
4. The User signs on through SSO and selects from a list of courses.
5. The User will now receive rewards for their avatar based on assignment submissions.

### Reliance Based Motivation

<i>As a User, I want to feel like my Virtual Pet is relying on me. When I see the Pet lose progress or become weak as a result of my procrastination, I am motivated to try hard for them.</i>

1. User has set up Canvas integration and has neglected an assignment.
2. As the assignment gets closer, the avatar becomes visibly hungry in a comically over-the-top-fashion.
3. When the due date for the assignment passes, the avatar becomes visibly upset.
4. A stat (or stats) assigned to the avatar lowers as a result of the due date for the assignment passing.
5. If a certain milestone is reached in the negative direction, the avatar will revert to a previous state corresponding to lowered progress.
6. The User can now retroactively complete the assignment and new rewards will be assigned based on results from Canvas Integration.

### Autodidact

<i> As a User, I want a place where I can create plans for practicing personal hobbies. I want to create a schedule and be encouraged by my Virtual Pet to adhere to the schedule.</i>

1. The User logs into their profile.
2. User navigates to the “Create Goal” tab.
3. User fills out a form with types of milestones and calendar information regarding due dates. These can be explicit calendar entries based on a particular date, or recur on a regular time interval.
4. The backend for the site builds a set of events for the avatar based on these milestones.
