# Version Control

- This project will utilize GitHub version control. 
- The main branch will be protected and changes will require a pull request approved by two team members to be merged.
  - Commits containing only documentation updates can be pushed directly to main.
- Each feature will be built in its own branch.
- Prior to each milestone demo, a release will be made on GitHub to preserve the status of the project at that point.
